## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RolyPoly, please report it
responsibly by emailing the maintainer directly rather than opening a
public issue.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

You can expect an initial response within 72 hours. Once the issue is
confirmed, a fix will be prioritised and released as a patch version.
