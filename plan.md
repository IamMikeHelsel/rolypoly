A Detailed Plan for Rewriting WinZip in Rust

1. Project Overview and Goals
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing a modern, cross-platform file archiver, inspired by WinZip, using the Rust programming language. The primary goals of this project are to create a high-performance, secure, and user-friendly application that leverages Rust's strengths in safety, concurrency, and performance.

The final product will be a desktop application that allows users to create, extract, and manage archive files, with a focus on the ZIP format. It will feature a modern graphical user interface (GUI) and will be available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Core Features
The initial version of the application will focus on the following core features:

ZIP File Creation:

Create new ZIP archives.

Add files and folders to existing ZIP archives.

Support for the DEFLATE compression algorithm.

ZIP File Extraction:

Extract entire archives.

Extract selected files and folders from an archive.

User Interface:

A clean, intuitive, and modern graphical user interface.

Display the contents of an archive in a file-explorer-like view.

Allow users to drag and drop files and folders into the application to create archives.

Cross-Platform Support:

A single codebase that compiles and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3. Technology Stack
The following technologies are recommended for this project:

Programming Language: Rust - For its performance, memory safety, and modern features.

Core ZIP Library: zip - A popular and well-maintained Rust crate for reading and writing ZIP archives.

GUI Framework: Tauri - A framework for building lightweight, cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for the frontend. This choice allows for a modern, flexible, and easily-styled UI.

Frontend Framework (Optional): React or Vue.js - To build the user interface within Tauri.

State Management (for Tauri): Tauri's built-in state management or a library like Redux or Pinia.

4. Development Plan - Phased Approach
The project will be developed in phases to ensure a structured and manageable workflow.

Phase 1: Core Logic and Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Objective: Implement the fundamental archive creation and extraction logic and test it with a simple CLI.

Tasks:

Project Setup:

Initialize a new Rust project using cargo new.

Add the zip crate as a dependency.

Archive Creation Logic:

Implement functions to create a new ZIP file.

Implement functions to add files and directories to a ZIP file.

Archive Extraction Logic:

Implement functions to extract all files from a ZIP archive.

Implement functions to extract specific files from a ZIP archive.

CLI Implementation:

Use a crate like clap to create a simple command-line interface.

The CLI should allow users to:

create <archive_name> <file1> <file2> ...

extract <archive_name>

list <archive_name>

Testing:

Write unit tests for the core logic.

Manually test the CLI with various files and folder structures.

Phase 2: GUI Implementation with Tauri
Objective: Build the graphical user interface for the application.

Tasks:

Tauri Setup:

Integrate Tauri into the existing Rust project.

Set up the frontend development environment (e.g., with Node.js, npm/yarn).

UI Design:

Create a simple UI layout with a file list view, toolbar, and status bar.

Use a modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for styling.

Frontend Development:

Implement the main application window.

Create components for the file list, toolbar buttons (Create, Extract, Add), and other UI elements.

Communication between Rust and Frontend:

Use Tauri's command system to call Rust functions from the JavaScript frontend.

Implement commands for creating and extracting archives.

Displaying Archive Contents:

When a user opens a ZIP file, the Rust backend will read the archive's contents and send the file list to the frontend for display.

Phase 3: Advanced Features
Objective: Add more advanced features to enhance the application's functionality.

Tasks:

Encryption:

Integrate AES encryption support using the zip crate's features.

Add UI elements for setting and entering passwords for encrypted archives.

Support for Other Archive Formats:

Investigate and integrate libraries for other formats like tar, 7z, etc.

The sevenz-rust crate can be considered for 7z support.

Self-Extracting Archives:

Research and implement a mechanism for creating self-extracting archives for different platforms.

Cloud Integration:

Integrate with popular cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive using their respective APIs.

Allow users to open archives from and save archives to their cloud accounts.

Drag and Drop:

Implement drag-and-drop functionality for adding files to an archive.

5. Project Timeline (Estimated)
Phase 1: 2-3 weeks

Phase 2: 4-6 weeks

Phase 3: 6-8 weeks

This timeline is an estimate and can be adjusted based on the development team's size and experience.

6. Conclusion
This plan provides a roadmap for developing a modern, robust, and cross-platform file archiver in Rust. By following a phased approach and leveraging the recommended technology stack, we can create a high-quality application that meets the needs of modern users. The focus on Rust ensures a secure and performant foundation, while the use of Tauri allows for a flexible and visually appealing user interface.
